| [PrivateBin](https://privatebin.info/) | PrivateBin is a self-hosted web application, meaning you deploy it on your own server. It runs entirely on the backend you control, with all encryption and decryption handled in the user’s browser, ensuring zero-knowledge privacy (It is self hostable but there is a public instance available to use). | PrivateBin is actively maintained, with regular contributions from its developers and the open-source community. The development status can be tracked via its GitHub repository, where contributors regularly add new features, fix bugs, and update the project to address security vulnerabilities. Updates happen often, although not always at the same time. The frequency of updates is determined by whether vulnerabilities, new features, or community-requested enhancements are found. Security updates and patches are often handled promptly.  The development team is relatively responsive to issues and pull requests on GitHub. If a security vulnerability is discovered, it is typically addressed swiftly, and users can also report them as well. There is limited information about the funding for Private Bin and have no known sponsorships. It is primarily supported by community contributors. | 2025-04-16 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⯪ (4.30) |
