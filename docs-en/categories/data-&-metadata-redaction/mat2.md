## Security and Privacy
- **Security Features**: MAT2 does not have dedicated security features as it primarily focuses on privacy by removing metadata from files. The tool's purpose is to strip EXIF data, location information, and device details embedded in files to prevent privacy leaks. However, it does not implement encryption, authentication, or other security measures like secure file transfer or data protection. Its privacy focus ensures no user data is collected, and it is open-source, allowing for transparency and community audits.
- **Data Collection Level**: No Data Collection
- **Security and Privacy Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4.00)

## Maintenance and Support
- **Maintenance Status**: Actively maintained. The project receives multiple updates per year, with recent commits as of 2025. Updates include bug fixes, support for new file formats, and dependency improvements. The development team is highly responsive. The lead developer, Julien Voisin, is active in maintaining the tool and responds to issues regularly on GitLab. Feature requests and bug reports are typically acknowledged within a few days. Indirectly funded through its use in larger projects. Tails OS (a privacy-focused live operating system) integrates MAT2 and receives NGO and foundation funding, which indirectly supports MAT2’s development (supported by the Tails ecosystem which is supported by organizations like Tor Project, Access Now, and others).

## Additional Information
- **Limitations and Vulnerabilities**: No Graphical User Interface (GUI): MAT2 is strictly a command-line tool, which may be a barrier for users who prefer a graphical interface. Limited to Local Environments: MAT2 works locally, meaning it doesn’t provide cloud integration or online features for easy file management across multiple devices. Limited Customization Options: While MAT2 is excellent at stripping metadata by default, it doesn’t offer much customization for advanced users who might want more granular control over the metadata removal process. Dependence on External Tools: MAT2 requires additional tools like ExifTool for certain types of metadata removal, which can add complexity for new users and increase setup time. Only Python-Based: MAT2 relies on Python, which may not be ideal for users who prefer tools built in other languages or for environments that do not easily support Python.
